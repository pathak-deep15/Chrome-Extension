# Chrome-Extension
This is my first chrome extension. It searches for the first hyper link on the page and then opens that link in another tab of your browser.

Clone this repository to a folder where you want to have your extension.

To load this extension in Chrome, open up chrome://extensions/ in your browser and click “Developer mode” in the top right. Now click “Load unpacked extension…” and select the extension’s directory. You should now see your extension in the list.

Now open a new tab(ensuring that your extension is active), and then click on the extension icon on the taskbar. the first hyperlink will be opened in the new tab.
